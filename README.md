It is a mix of the following two packages

* [UniVrm](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM)
* [Shader Graphs MToon for URP VR](https://github.com/simplestargame/ShaderGraphsMToonForURPVR)

The UniVrm version of this package is v0.79.0.

Just import this package into your Universal Render Pipeline project, drag and drop the Vrm file, and your shaders will appear just fine.
