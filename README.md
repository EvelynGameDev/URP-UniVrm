# URP UniVrm

This package also makes sure that the shaders of the Vroid model are properly displayed in Unity's Universal Render Pipeline.

It is a mix of the following two packages

* [UniVrm](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM)
* [Shader Graphs MToon for URP VR](https://github.com/simplestargame/ShaderGraphsMToonForURPVR)

The UniVrm version of this package is v0.82.1.

Drag and drop the unipackage file into your Unity project to use it.

[URPUniVrm_ver_1_0_3.unitypackage](https://github.com/akihisaArchieSakai/URP-UniVrm/releases/tag/ver-1.0.3)

Just import this package into your Universal Render Pipeline project, drag and drop the Vrm file, and toon shaders will appear just fine.

## Requirements

* Unity 2020.3.X or higher is recommended

(The shader graph doesn't seem to import well in 2019.4.X. I'm waiting for a pull request from someone who knows more about it.)
